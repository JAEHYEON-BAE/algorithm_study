### 문제 설명

<p>Esspe-Peasee is an ancient game played by children throughout the land of Acmania. The rules are simple: </p>

<p>A player simply quibs the yorba at the kwonk. If the yorba hurms the kwonk the player gets a foom. If the yorba hurfs the kwonk the player gets a foob. </p>

<p>The objective is to get a twob with as few quibs as possible.</p>

<p>Every group of children has its own opinion regarding the value of a foom, the value of a foob, and the value of a twob. However, everyone agrees that a foob is worth more than a foom, and that a twob is worth more than a foob. You may assume that a foom and a foob can each be represented by a 32 bit integer, and a twob can be represented by a 64 bit integer. </p>

### 입력 

 <p>You will be given a number of game instances to solve. Each instance is specified by 3 non-negative integers that represent the value of a foom, a foob and a twob, respectively. The final line contains three 0's and should not be processed.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each instance your program should print "A fooms and B foobs for a twob!", on a line by itself as shown in the samples below, where the value of “A” fooms plus “B” foobs add up to a twob, and the sum of “A” and “B” is as small as possible. “fooms” and “foobs” should be appropriately pluralised, as shown in “Output for the Sample Input” below. </p>

<p>If there is no such pair you should print out the age-old chant:  “Unquibable!”</p>
